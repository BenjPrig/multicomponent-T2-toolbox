The current implementation is written in Python 2.7 (and we plan to switch to Python 3.x.)

Ten estimation algorithms are currently implemented, including the individual combinations of the three penalty terms (i.e., **I** = identity matrix, **L1** = first-order Laplacian derivative, and **L2** = second-order Laplacian derivative) and three criteria to estimate the optimal regularization weight (i.e., Chi-square residual fitting (**X2**), **L-curve**, and Generalized Cross-Validation (**GCV**)), as well as the non-regularized Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS). All algorithms were named based on the resulting combination: `X2-I, X2-L1, X2-L2, L-curve-I, L-curve-L1, L-curve-L2, GCV-I, GCV-L1, GCV-L2, and NNLS`.
